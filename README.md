# Ship Motion Mimicking and Self-Stabilizing Platform Project

![Alt Text](Stewart_gif.gif)


## Overview
This is my undergraduate project aimed at mimicking ship motion and developing a self-stabilizing platform. The project focuses on accurately replicating the dynamic movements of a ship and ensuring that the platform remains stable under various simulated conditions.

## Project Components
- **Ship Motion Mimicry**: Implementing algorithms to replicate the motion dynamics of a ship.
- **Self-Stabilizing Platform**: Designing and testing a platform that can counteract motion to remain stable.
- **CAD Models**: Detailed CAD models of the platform and associated components are available for reference.

## Available Resources
- **[Project Report](Stewart_Platform_1.pdf)**: A comprehensive report detailing the projectâ€™s objectives, methodologies, and results.
- **[CAD Models](CAD2.0)**: Access the CAD models used in this project.

## Future Updates
The final pipeline, including Arduino/Raspberry Pi integration, will be posted soon after concluding all tests.
